I have added a registration and login system to access the chatbox app (Echobox). 

Basically the authentication system has a separate database: register
with a table: users
This contains data: id, username, password,email,join_date

The app itself originally has a database: Echoit
with a table: echos
This contains data: id, user, message, time.

Had issues with styling (changes in css codes seems not to affect the application page until tested with firefox) still going to improve it soon but i'm trying to learn more for other project ideas.
